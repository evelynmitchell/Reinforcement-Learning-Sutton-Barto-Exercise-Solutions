# Reinforcement-Learning-Sutton-Barto-Exercise-Solutions
Chapter notes and exercise solutions for Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction, 2nd edition
by Richard S. Sutton and Andrew G. Barto.  The book in its entirety can be found here: http://www.incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html

Most chapters are saved in individual folders with .jl files containing Pluto.jl notebooks.  Some notebooks have been saved as html and pdf files that are viewable as static documents.  HTML files contain instructions on how to run the notebook files locally.

To run any notebook files locally:

1. Download the notebook
2. Run Pluto (see instructions on installing julia and pluto noting that a newer version of julia might currently be available: https://computationalthinking.mit.edu/Spring21/installation/)
3. Open the notebook file by typing the saved filename in the open box in the web browser.

Note: Not all notebooks are available here.  I am editing them to allow proper export and will be adding chapters one at a time.
